  Decomposes architecture and requirements into actionable development tasks:
  - Creates work breakdown structure (WBS)
  - Identifies task dependencies
  - Sequences tasks for optimal flow
  - Generates GitHub issues from tasks
  - Maps tasks to team members based on skills
  - Defines task acceptance criteria

  - "Break down architecture into implementation tasks"
  - "Identify task dependencies and sequencing"
  - "Create GitHub issues with proper labels and templates"
  - "Map tasks to required skills and expertise"
  - "Generate sprint/iteration plans"
  - "Define task acceptance criteria"
  - "Estimate task granularity and scope"
