# Language Selection Workflow

This workflow guides the selection of the most appropriate programming language(s) for a project, avoiding defaults.

## 1. Analysis Phase
1. **Problem Definition**:
   - Analyze the problem description and constraints
   - Identify key performance and scalability requirements

2. **Candidate Identification**:
   - List 3-5 potential languages (e.g., Rust, Go, Python, TS)
   - Categorize them (System, Backend, Scripting, Frontend)

## 2. Evaluation Phase
1. **Criteria Definition**:
   - Define evaluation criteria (Performance, Ecosystem, Dev Speed, etc.)

2. **Comparison**:
   - Create a comparison table (Rows=Languages, Cols=Criteria)
   - Rate each language against the criteria

## 3. Selection Phase
1. **Ranking**:
   - Rank the languages based on the specific problem context
   - Justify the ranking with concrete reasons

2. **Decision**:
   - Select the top 1-2 languages
   - Explicitly justify why others were rejected
   - **Rule**: If Python is chosen, provide specific justification

## 4. Implementation Planning
1. **Architecture Design**:
   - Define high-level architecture using the chosen language(s)
   - Map components to languages

2. **Guidelines**:
   - Provide project structure and core code examples
   - Define build and deployment strategy

3. **Documentation**:
   - Document the decision process for future reference
