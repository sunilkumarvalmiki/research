# Go Development Rules
# Version: 1.0.0

go:
  version: "1.0.0"
  go_version: ">=1.21"
  
  tooling:
    formatter: "gofmt or goimports"
    linter: "golangci-lint"
    test_framework: "go test (built-in)"
    package_manager: "go modules"
  
  structure:
    layout: "standard Go project layout"
    required_files:
      - "go.mod"
      - "go.sum"
      - "README.md"
  
  style:
    line_length: 100
    indentation: "tabs"
    use_gofmt: true
  
  naming:
    packages: "lowercase, single word"
    types: "PascalCase"
    interfaces: "PascalCase (usually -er suffix)"
    functions: "camelCase or PascalCase (exported)"
    variables: "camelCase or PascalCase (exported)"
    constants: "camelCase or PascalCase (exported)"
  
  error_handling:
    - "Return errors, don't panic"
    - "Check all errors"
    - "Wrap errors with context"
    - "Use errors.Is and errors.As"
  
  concurrency:
    - "Use channels for communication"
    - "Use mutexes for shared state"
    - "Always use defer to unlock"
    - "Use context for cancellation"
  
  testing:
    coverage_min: 80
    test_files: "*_test.go"
    table_driven_tests: recommended
  
  best_practices:
    - "Accept interfaces, return structs"
    - "Keep interfaces small"
    - "Use defer for cleanup"
    - "Avoid package-level state"
    - "Use go vet and staticcheck"
