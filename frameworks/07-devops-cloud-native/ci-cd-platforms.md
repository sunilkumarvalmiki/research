# CI/CD Platforms

## Major Platforms

**GitHub Actions**: GitHub-native (marketplace, free for public repos, YAML-based)
**GitLab CI**: Integrated platform (auto DevOps, runner flexibility, self-hosted option)
**Jenkins**: Traditional (plugin ecosystem, self-hosted, declining for new projects)
**Argo CD**: GitOps for K8s (declarative, drift detection, pull-based)
**Flux**: CNCF graduated (GitOps, Kubernetes-native, HelmRelease support)

**Recommendation**: GitHub Actions for simplicity, Argo CD for Kubernetes GitOps.

**Last Updated**: December 2024
