# Desktop Application Frameworks

Comprehensive analysis of Electron, Tauri, Flutter Desktop, .NET MAUI, and Qt for building cross-platform desktop applications.

## Key Findings

**Tauri**: Modern choice (Rust-based, 600KB apps, WebView-based)
**Electron**: Established (VS Code, Slack, but 120MB+ apps)
**Flutter Desktop**: Cross-platform consistency (shared codebase with mobile)
**.NET MAUI**: Microsoft ecosystem (C#, Windows/Mac/iOS/Android)
**Qt**: Native performance (C++, mature, complex)
